# Personal Portfolio Website

This repository holds the source code and files for my personal portfolio website. It’s built using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. My curiosity drives me daily, prompting me to constantly learn and seek out new challenges. Alongside this, I’m passionate about leadership, stepping up to create spaces where curiosity, authenticity, and problem-solving come together. Each project I take on, like this portfolio, is a reflection of my desire to work with others who share that same authenticity, fostering a community where everyone leads, learns, and grows together.
